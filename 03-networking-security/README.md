## Cloudflare Tunnel
### Why Cloudflare Tunnel over a reverse proxy + load balancer?
- First, Cloudflare Tunnel is an efficient solution because it has built-in load balancing capabilities. This distributes traffic effectively across multiple servers or services, providing the benefits of load balancing and high availability without the overhead of a dedicated one.
- Additionally, using cloudflared is a simple alternative that eliminates the need to set up and manage a complex infrastructure. This is ideal when you don't require granular traffic control.
- Its seamless integration with containerized environments is another key advantage. Since services in these environments scale dynamically, Cloudflare Tunnel automatically handles routing and security, unlike a traditional load balancer that requires additional configuration.
- Finally, by exposing applications through Cloudflare Tunnel, they gain the full benefits of Cloudflare's DNS, CDN, and DDoS services, as well as its WAF, API, and bot servicesâ€”all without exposing the application servers directly to the internet.

## Firewall
All ports must say closed. We open only 443 and 80 for web traffic only.
